# Disco Elysium Dialogue Searcher
 
Small flask project to find dialogue lines from the Disco Elysium Final Cut Edition DB found at https://fayde.seadragonlair.co.uk/

Mainly used when I want to find Disco Elysium lines and https://fayde.co.uk/ is down. This is a much simpler program compared to that.

Features:
Filter lines from Disco Elysium by Actors and dialogue keywords

Instructions:
1) Install python 3.11
2) Clone this repo (or download it through some other means idk)
3) Go to the directory where the repo is located in terminal/cmd and type "python -m venv [your environment name here]"
4) In the same directory, type "flask run"


I know this readme's instrcutions isn't very good, I'll get back to this at some point. Feel free to email me at contact@domloh.com for anything regarding this project.
